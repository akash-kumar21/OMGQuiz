  <h1>OMG - A Quiz!</h1>
  <p>The three most impactful things I learned this year in CS Topics so far are...</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I learned about the timeline of the internet. It was interesting how something so influential in our daily lives only began 60 years ago. In addition, it was somewhat surprising that the internet was born from government research.</li>
    <li>I also learned that the internet was built to be indestructible. No matter what device, content, media, or vendor you're dealing with, the internet will be compatible. </li>
    <li>I learned that HTML is not a programming language, but rather provides context and meaning for data. </li>
  </ol>
